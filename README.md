# KUBRIK: Brick Destroyer
Feb 2020

Disclaimer:
While apparently simple, Kubrik, thematically makes use of a specific ideology, for storytelling purposes, while acknowledging that all ideologies start pure, but end up falling according to individual flaws. 


The cold war was fought in many fronts, and in the 80’s a special department was created inside the Kremlin for the dissemination of socialist ideals through alternative mediums. The department’s name was “The Digital Sickle”.
For years they toiled away developing the first 2d tridimensional game that also permits a versus cooperative gameplay, the Kubrik project. We shall now explain these seemingly antagonistic declarations.
While visually represented in a 2d plane, Kubrik’s takes on a 3rd conceptual dimension. In both gamemodes, Kubrik players fight to overcome personal and societal barriers in the pursuit of the common good.
In the single proletariat mode, the player engages against overwhelming odds, chipping away at Society while engaging it through the back and forth of speech and actions, represented by the moving social cube. While carving his space by destroying bricks of the status quo wall, the players will have to deal with the increase of personal responsibilities as time passes, represented by the increase of the social cube’s speed. The goal, completely remove the barrier between the upper and lower points of society, will become harder with time, and it is not sure the player will be able to reach it before perishing.

In the versus/cooperative mode, 2 well intentioned perspectives with opposing views debate through cube manipulation about how would be the optimal way of resolving inequities. Each will receive the opposing argument in the form of the moving social cube and offer their rebuttal by sending it back. Missing the social cube means losing an argument and who loses the most arguments recognizes the other side’s philosophy as the better alternative. At the end, no matter who wins, we all win.



## Project description:
First <Academida de Código_> bootcamp group project: Kaká Cordovil, Fábio Veloso, Diego Senra, Leandro Monteiro, Pedro Tomás. A team's main challenge is to create a project product using only the Java language and an internal library academy.

## The Project Idea
Classic arcade game that the objective is destroying all the bricks with a ball hit by a base, the ball cannot go beyond the limit of this base that works like a racket.
The project had to be developed in a week.

## The Development
We divided the project into sprints of about 8 hours of interval. We started by reading the lyrics of the song and watching 
the videoclip. We then brainstormed the basic idea for the project. When the group was satisfied with the idea, we set out to 
build the structure of the project and map the database.
Afterwards, we split the group into two parts: backend and frontend. The frontend group began working on the project 
design using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies. In terms of backend, we started structuring the project by creating 
packages and their respective classes, and started implementing their methods, with the intention of ensuring fluid database
communication. Persistence tests were made using Postman software. Finally, we joined backend and frontend development together.

After the random division of groups, we had a meeting to brainstorm and discuss what the project would be like. It was decided to move on with the brick game.
At the first meeting, we still divided the project's water quality and the division of classes, their properties and what they did. However, we started developing the backend code, parallel to the frontend code to see how the game performed in development, and to solve the bugs.
Based on the same code we also developed a second multiplayer game: the pong.
