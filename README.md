# Brick Destroyer: KUBRICK

Feb 2020

Project description:
First <Academida de C칩digo_> bootcamp group project: Kak치 Cordovil, F치bio Veloso, Diego Senra, Leandro Monteiro, Pedro Tom치s.

## The Project Idea
Classic arcade game that the objective is destroying all the bricks with a ball hit by a base, the ball cannot go beyond the limit of this base that works like a racket.
The project had to be developed in a week.

## The Development
We divided the project into sprints of about 8 hours of interval. We started by reading the lyrics of the song and watching 
the videoclip. We then brainstormed the basic idea for the project. When the group was satisfied with the idea, we set out to 
build the structure of the project and map the database.
Afterwards, we split the group into two parts: backend and frontend. The frontend group began working on the project 
design using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies. In terms of backend, we started structuring the project by creating 
packages and their respective classes, and started implementing their methods, with the intention of ensuring fluid database
communication. Persistence tests were made using Postman software. Finally, we joined backend and frontend development together.

After the random division of groups, we had a meeting to brainstorm and discuss what the project would be like. It was decided to move on with the brick game.
At the first meeting, we still divided the project's water quality and the division of classes, their properties and what they did. However, we started developing the backend code, parallel to the frontend code to see how the game performed in development, and to solve the bugs.
Based on the same code we also developed a second multiplayer game: the pong.
